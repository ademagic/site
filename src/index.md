I'm a user-focused developer from Australia with over 10 years of experience building beautiful and accessible designs. I specialise in Design Systems and CSS architecture, and love enabling teams to do the same.

Currently the Engineering Lead for the Design Operations team at [Finder.com.au](http://finder.com.au/).
