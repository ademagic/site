If you know me, you know I blame all my hangups in Design on how long it takes me to decide on typography. Here's me having a second (and probably not last) go at improving it.

### Inline Code Blocks Facelift
You know, the `<code/>` ones. They already steal enough cognitive attention without also being huge and bold. Now they're the same size as the text, with a little extra breathing room. Also changed some of the colours around to make them a little more subtle.

### Actual Font Weights
I thought I kept importing bad Google Fonts, when actually I was using the Fonts v1 API syntax with a v2 API request. D'oh, Miko.

For now, I've imported two other weights for the Frank Ruhl Libre font family so that <strong>the strong tags</strong> have some more visual weight. More typography changes to come, I'm sure.

### Credits Page
I really like <a href="https://dbanks.design" rel="external">Danny Banks</a>'s site, and I thought the idea of the open-source credits page was cool. So I've replaced the Hylia link in the footer with a link to my [Credits](/credits) page. Hopefully more things make it on here as I go more crazy than just updating typography.

Next one's the homepage, I swear.
