I recently read the [personal experience of a JavaScript developer working remotely](https://dev.to/viktoriabors/dark-side-of-remote-work-personal-experience-5dch). While many of their experiences resonated with me, there were a few that I felt I'd come across and managed to resolve for myself. It also got me thinking about how my perspective on working remotely has changed over the years, especially since it was thrust upon us all throughout the global emergency that was the COVID-19 pandemic. And with that, I think it's important to set one thing straight...

## Working From Home !== Remote Work

This is a crucial distinction I felt I had to make. Throughout the pandemic, many of us were forced to Work From Home. To our workplaces, that may mean "remote" work, like the opposite of local, as we're not working at the office. The reality is that "local" was redefined. "Remote" no longer existed.

We were forced to do our day jobs from our homes, and most of us weren't ready for it. Some worked from their study, some from their bedrooms, some from the kitchen because their partner had already claimed the office workstation. Many managed to reconfigure their houses to optimise, many barely had the space to do anything. The point is our hands were forced and we were restricted. This is a stressful situation even without the looming threat to your health and dwindling toilet paper supplies.

I have to preface that in all my roles, I've had the luxury of having an office local to me, and if I did work completely remotely it was for a short time. I started working remotely almost a decade before the pandemic hit. I'm not including working with teams in different timezones, but actually having the capability to work from anywhere for any reason at any time. I'm a big fan of remote work.

In those days, that could mean:

1. Working from my bedroom because I didn't want to share my cold with my coworkers.
2. Taking a meeting from my mechanic's lobby while I waited for my car to be serviced.
3. Working from a cafe because I didn't have any meetings that day and the weather is nice.

Yes, working from home is technically working remotely. But call it a subset, if you will. There are freedoms (and responsibilities) to working remotely that are important to recognise. If you don't, and your employer doesn't either, then you're all gonna have a bad time.

## How to make sure Remote Work doesn't suck

With the above in mind, I want to outline some of the bad sides of Remote Work, and what (if anything) I do to get around it.

### You need boundaries between work, rest and play

One of my previous bosses used to talk about your "Triangle of Life"; i.e. a manageable distance you keep between your work, rest and play. He lived 10 mins drive from his office, and he spent some weekends at his local airport working on or flying his plane. That triangle not only got smaller during the pandemic, sometimes one the points would disappear. It's too easy to forget.
