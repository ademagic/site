> This is part of a series. You can check out the original post called [Chipping away at my Reading List](/blog/chipping-away-at-my-reading-list), where you'll also find the other posts. At the time of writing, my reading list is *231 items*.

## Part 3: Whittling away the other resources

I've given this a break while I've been unwell, and am coming back with a fresh(er) mind. So hopefully this is the easy step.
There are a few other lists I keep where I have things that could be considered readings. I really shouldn't be maintaining these, or at least not putting readings in there. If I did in the past, I need to move them so I can actually get to them.

The "other resources" looks like:

- 41 blogposts in my Blogposts list.
- 14 books in my Books To Read list.
- 4 Saved posts in Linkedin.

So that's **59** potential things to get rid of from my list of **231**. Let's do this.

1. Readings need to go into the Readings lists
2. Useful resources need to go to that *list of resources* I made in the last step. Or, grouped and organised accordingly.
3. As before, *delete everything I'm done with*.

## Some Notes

- My list of blogposts were things I wanted to *write*, mostly. Shouldn't have counted that, but ya gotta bump up those numbers. Some of those went to the reading list and I'm now not counting it anymore.
- My Books To Read list was mostly industry stuff, which I've moved into Readings. There are a few sci-fi books in there which I'm not counting anymore either.
- There are [articles written](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/quest-find-saved-linkedin-posts-scott-stockwell/) about how to find your saved posts on LinkedIn's desktop app. No wonder I don't use it; I've moved the articles I have to resources and will never be saving any again.

## How it went

These lists are knocked out now, at least. Everything is now consolidated.
Which means I removed **59** posts from my reading list, and through saving some, added back 15. My reading list is at a nice round number of **190**.

A good place to start from... ?
