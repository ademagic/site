After a much needed week of rest and family time in beautiful Fiji, I'm itching to do another release of the site. It's been too long since my last one, so I'm deploying what I worked on before I left, and rushed through a few things I've been wanting to do for a while.

## New Horizontal Rule styles

They were the most iconic design element of the starter template I used. I didn't know how I wanted them to look but felt I needed to change them. It's by no means final, and I'm working on a bigger design change, but anyways they've changed this release.

## Removing the home link from the navigation

Another bit of legacy from the starter template, the Dark Mode toggle does not respond well with the header navigation when there are 3 nav elements in it. I removed the home link since you could get there by clicking on my logo. Like I said above, once the big redesign happens I'll make this more useful.

## Spotify Embed

I listen to music a lot while I work. One of the things I really liked about my old site is associating content I write with the music I listened to at the time. Couldn't wait to bring this one back, peep it at the top of this post (and all the others, too!).

## Tag Component improvements

I use the Tag component any time I'm referencing a tag now, so I made some code changes to make it more robust.

## Replacing fonts with System Fonts

Big fan of the system fonts, and one of the things that stuck out to me on my blazingly fast statically generated site was the [FOUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content#:~:text=A%20flash%20of%20unstyled%20content,before%20all%20information%20is%20retrieved.) before the fonts load.

I replaced the fonts that came with the starter template with an [Old Style Modern Font Stack](https://github.com/system-fonts/modern-font-stacks#old-style) for the Serif fonts, and System UI for the Sans-Serif ones. Read more about [Modern Font Stack](https://modernfontstacks.com/).

## Now page

Something I've noticed on many IndieWebsites I like recently([Maggie Appleton's](https://maggieappleton.com/now), [Elly Loell's](https://www.ellyloel.com/now/), [Sara Joy's](https://sarajoy.dev/basic/#now) and probably many others) is the [Now page](https://nownownow.com). More stable than social media, less permanent than an About page. It's a concept I can really get behind, and something I plan to work on more. And if you like the idea of owning your web presence, you should too!
