## Blog

- the release page is now a simpler list, grouped by date, and sorted by latest.
- the blog page will now only show pages which are under 24 months old. Any older post moves to the [blog archive](/blog/archive).

## Blogposts

- the bottom of the Blogposts now contains a list of related posts organised by tag. There's also a "Next Post", in case I feel a post has a logical successor you should read.

## Now page

- I decided to remove all entries other than the current month's. It's a now page, not a _then_ page, right?
- I am writing a series of posts about [chipping away at my reading list](/tags/chipping-away). I've added the list length to my Now widget.

## Other stuff

- AI crawlers are now blocked in my [robots.txt](https://github.com/ademagic/ademagic.github.io/blob/master/robots.txt). Thanks to [Joe Bell's suggestion](https://twitter.com/joebell_/status/1713160767577485504), and credit to [cyberciti.biz](https://www.cyberciti.biz/web-developer/block-openai-bard-bing-ai-crawler-bots-using-robots-txt-file/).
- A Halloween colour scheme. So?
