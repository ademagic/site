## Blog

- the release page is now a simpler list, grouped by date, and sorted by latest.
- the blog page will now only show pages which are under 24 months old. Any older post moves to the [blog archive](/blog/archive).

## Now page

- I decided to remove all entries other than the current month's. It's a now page, not a _then_ page, right?
- I am writing a series of posts about [chipping away at my reading list](/tags/chipping-away). I've added the list length to my Now widget.
