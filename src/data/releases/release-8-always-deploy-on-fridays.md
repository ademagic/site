I swore to ship every Monday, but it turns out I don't code on the weekends. So here's a thing of changes, deployed on a <s>Friday</s> Saturday, because deploying on a Friday is a surefire way to have bugs in your build.

I'm off to sacrifice to the deployment gods, enjoy your weekend.

## Moving Releases away from Blogposts

I thought about it some more [after my last release](/releases/release-7-tags) and decided Releases aren't blogposts at all. I've also been thinking about different ways to display blogposts vs releases so I created a separate route - They now live on the [Releases](/releases) page.

## Get my mug off the Social cards

I cringe when I post a link to one of my posts on Twitter or Mastodon, and I get to see a picture of my Avatar again. I've extended this a bit so I can provide a different image on a per-post level, and have replaced the default image with something I found on unsplash that I thought looked cool.

## Re-do of the footer

I wanted to make more pages for my site that didn't fit my navigation architecture. I've been admiring the websites of [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/) and [Andy Bell](https://andy-bell.co.uk/), so I borrowed some ideas (even some code) and redid my footer. There's another list of links there now.
