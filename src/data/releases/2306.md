A fairly thin release this month. I wrote a [couple](/blog/just-post) of [blogposts](/blog/how-i-verified-myself-on-mastodon) at the beginning of the month, and havent worked on anything since. I've planned a few features I hope to work on and deploy next month so here's hoping I regain some momentum.

## Image Attribution in Blogposts

I've added some frontmatter that stores the image attribution link data from Unsplash. I use this as a template to add a little caption to my blogpost images. Added some less than ideal alt text to these as well.

## Dulled images on Dark Mode

Took some inspiration from [a twitter thread by Joe Bell](https://twitter.com/joebell_/status/1635199477647831041?s=20). When you're viewing my website in Dark Mode, every image should have a bit of the saturation toned down. Hopefully this makes it a little less straining in the dark.

## HTTPS

Yep, after a littlebit of a dance-about, and a littlebit of downtime, my website is now served over HTTPS. Shoutout to [2MHost](https://www.2mhost.com/) for making this super easy for me.

## Various Bugfixes and improvements

- security updates to dependencies (thanks, Dependabot!)
