Once again, a lack of work on my website. Between work busyness, various illnesses, and holidays, there hasn't been much time. Hopefully next month is more fruitful.
I did write [a blogpost on Mastodon for newcomers](/blog/notes-on-mastodon) I guess.

## Blocking Google Bots

After reading ["Permission" by Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/journal/20315), I decided that I didn't need to optimise my site for bot crawlability. I decided to block Google from crawling my site, as far as I knew. My [repost of this](https://indieweb.social/@ademagic/110698140239508095) was probably my most interacted with piece of content on social media, so I assume it resonated with some of you as well.

I may write a post on how I did this soon.

✌️
