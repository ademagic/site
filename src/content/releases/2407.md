## Upgrades

- Upgraded Astro to v4. A relatively smooth process that only gets smoother.
- Bumped my website version to 1.0.0. Semantic versioning doesn't really make sense for this, but what made less sense was 0.0.1 in my package file.

## RSS

- Added an [RSS feed](/rss.xml) to my site of my blogs, ordered by most recent. I don't know if this is the right way to do this.
