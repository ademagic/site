## Astro Content Collection migration

- Upgraded to Astro 3.5.7
- Migrated my Blogposts and Releases to Content Collections. Hope this gives me more flexibility with data/content types and maybe a bit of typesafety for ease of use.

## Other stuff

- Removed colour schemes/flavours. It was fun at the time but my implementation was buggy and the novelty wore off.

✌️
