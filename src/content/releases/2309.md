## Blog lists rework

I made a bunch of changes to the way I show blogs on my site. In summary,

- Got rid of the concept of a "featured" post. I kinda forgot why I wanted this.
- The homepage now contains a list of the three most recent blog posts I wrote, all of them with the featured treatment.
- The blog page reuses the blog card grid to list posts
- Some general updates to the blog card design

## A slightly more dynamic "Now" page

The [Now Page widget](/now) will now contain the track I last listened to at build time, courtesy of the LastFM API. More to come, I guess?

## Astro Upgrade to v3.1.2

Not like I felt the need to, but I upgraded my Astro version to v3. I'm interested in giving the view transitions api a go at some point.
