- usual workflow is to copy and paste existing post and change the values of frontmatter
- migrating seemed like lots of work, putting off due to juggling type definitions
- wanted to start with one part of content, i.e. releases, but as soon as I switched over Astro started using new API and not having results for Astro.glob queries
- astro tooling for vscode is great, massive help
