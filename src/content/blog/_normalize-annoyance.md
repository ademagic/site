I read [Be a Technical Mentor, Not a Micromanager](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/be-a-technical-mentor-not-a-micromanager-f4aa096692ad) by [Joey Freund](https://medium.com/@joeyfreundto). Overall, the article covers some good practices for effective and supportive engineering manangement. But one bit is still ringing in my head.

> encourage your reports to get annoyed

Out of context it's a pretty non-impactful sentence, and could even be taken the wrong way – as can my post's title. Joey is recommending that you encourage your reports to take mild inconveniences seriously. You should help them embrace it, and give them space to solve it. In his words, "If you help your team uncover frustrating issues that are and fixable, they will take care of the rest."

I agree with this completely. In fact (and you may have guessed it), I don't think you should encourage it – I think you should _normalize_ it. Here's all the reasons why.

## Happy Reports Lie, Annoyed Reports are Invested

... either in your team, or in themselves.

We've all been in this 1:1 before, and we've been in it from both sides. The manager says "hows things with you, anything you want to chat about?", and the report responds "No, everything's great". That's likely a lie, but the power dynamic is in the manager's favour, and the report feels they don't have enough leverage to complain. Either their annoyances seem insignificant, or sharing them won't make a positive difference. Lie might be a strong word, but there's a good chance they're less happy than they lead on. 

Annoyed reports show that the things they care about – the things that make them good at what they're paid for – aren't right. It's on the manager to give them the space and encouragement to fix it. Obviously, this could include their mental health, financial wellbeing and work-life balance; an "annoyance" here may only be fixed by leaving their job, but objectively that's not a bad resolution for either side.

The point is, being annoyed shows that you are invested. You want what's best, and you know what needs to be done to make it so.

As a manager, its your job to foster this response and reward it. Make people happy by letting them air what's wrong so they can work it out with you. Then, give them space and responsibility to fix it. 

## Balancing the Team Dynamic

An unhappy or negative team member is often a detractor from the team's mood. A vocal critic can draw out similar opinions and open up useful discussions. If those discussions aren't channeled into a constructive output, or if they're met/followed with more negativity and cynicisim, it can have the opposite effect. It's important to show that airing an annoyance actually turns into identifying a problem and owning a solution.

A habit I've found helpful is to "step backward, then step forward". By which I mean,
1. First, consider how this annoyance came to be. Does it affect how you interpret the issue?
2. Then, consider what the response to your feedback will be. What do you think will be said? Given your step backward, what would _you_ say?

This helps turn annoyances into constructive (but still annoyed) feedback, and is an appreciated skill in stakeholder management as well. Ideally, this also turns a critic into part of the solution, rather than being seen as a naysayer. The thing that irks you is now making its way to becoming a business case.

## Framing Annoyance

The "Detractors" I mentioned earlier are very expensive members of the team. They negatively impact the team's/company's bottom line, and they are often flagged in some way or another by upper management. People don't like to work with detractors. They become annoyances.

As a manager, it's also your job to sing your team's praises. Once you've helped to create a culture of voicing annoyances within your team, it's up to you to frame them as initiatives and successes of the individuals that found them. This fosters team trust, both internally and externally. Detractors have suddenly become star performers.
